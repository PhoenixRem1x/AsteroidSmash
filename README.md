# AsteroidSmash
This was my Create Performance Task for AP CSP.
It mainly uses the CMU_Graphics library from Carnegie Mellon University, which is based on PyGame. https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/desktop

The ship has semi-realistic physics. I made this before taking a physics course, and the game gets most of the physics right.


# Goal of the Game
- Spin around & Shoot asteroids
- Don't run into asteroids.
- 3 Lives
- Get the Largest Highscore





The graphics utilized in the game are not my own; see the credits in the first few lines of main.py
